# Controller-Designer-DC-Motor-Phase-Lag-Control-System
Modeled and controlled a DC motor for speed regulation using a phase lag controller designed in MATLAB and implemented in Proteus. Simulated a complete closed-loop system with real-time speed measurement output in rad/sec, suitable for robotics and automation.
